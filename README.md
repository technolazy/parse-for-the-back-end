# [Parse for the Back-End][published url]
## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


Parse is a powerful cloud service for supplying web application back-ends. With a simple REST API, you can connect to the Parse service for saving application data—both JSON structured data as well as media files. Facebook has recently announced that they will discontinue the Parse service, but fortunately they're providing a migration path to self-hosting the Parse server.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reginald Dawson will show you how to use Parse to host the data for your app. You'll see how to create and log in users as well as how to save and retrieve data. Most importantly, you'll learn how to migrate a Parse application to Heroku so that it can be easily self-hosted.
